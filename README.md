Introduction
----------------
- Earthquake is something which can not be predicted. However, it can be detected and if proper step is taken at early stage of earthquake, human loss can be prevented to a great extent. The precautionary steps includes ducking under a table or desk while the earthquake occurs, calmly moving out of the building in some open area, staying away from the electric pole and so on. 
- Research shows that most of the human loss beacuse of earthquake is due to people not being able to take these precautionary measure in time while inturn is due to people not realizing that the earthquake is taking place. **DCAlert** is an app that detects earthquake and immediately tells the user to take the precautionary measure. 
-Even if the earthquake has taken place during night and people are sleeping, this app alerts the user that earthquake is taking place and displays what to do next. 
- It is also seen that people panic a lot during earthquake due to which they get numb and are unable to evacuate in time. This app also tries to calm down people and clearly displays what they need to do during earthquake. 

Approach
---------------
- This app utilizes data from sensor which detects movement and the alert mechanism of the app is activated if the sensor detects movement.
- The sensor is attached to the beam or pillar of a building, the sensor runs on battery and the sensor sends signal to the app if it detects motion of the beam. The beam is something which vibrates the most compared to walls and other places of a building.
- Once the alert mechanism of the app is activated, it plays a siren to alert the user and displays the steps to be taken during earthquake.
- Once the user has seen the alert message, this app plays calming music so that the user doesn't panic

Usability 
------------------
- This app is easy to use.
- One needs to install a battery in the sensor, peel out the tape covering in the sensor, and then stick the sensor in a beam or pillar or if not available, the sensor can also be stick in the wall.
- The app automatically detects the sensor.
